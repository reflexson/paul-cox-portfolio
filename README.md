# paul-cox-portfolio

## Description

This project is a website to display my portfolio. It contains a header, about me section, projects section, contact section and a footer. There are links in the header to navigate the page, and external links to projects, my email, my instagram, and a future linkedin profile. The site is responsive to resizing and is easy to navigate.  It is a great template that I can fill in with more items as I go on through this course. 



I learned a lot about how to properly organize a webpage so that other developers and users can easily view, navigate, add to, or edit this site. I also was able to learn and practice git procedures for pushing, pulling, branching, adding files, commiting, creating pull requests, and merging branches through github. Incorporating responsive design was also something I learned quite a bit about during this project.
